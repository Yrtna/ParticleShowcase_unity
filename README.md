# Particle Showcase

For excellent quality, download the unity project and open [Assets/Scenes/ParticleScene](https://github.com/Yrtna/ParticleShowcase_unity/blob/master/Assets/Scenes/ParticleScene.unity).

Every effect is made from scratch using materials from [Unity Particle Pack](https://assetstore.unity.com/packages/essentials/asset-packs/unity-particle-pack-5-x-73777)
